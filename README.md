Hi there.

I was fifteen years old when I decided to start learning web development, and after some time I started my first IT work. I have more than seven years of experience working in test automation, project management, and web/mobile development.

Today, I work for the e-commerce of a global brand with large-scale systems doing new projects and integrations with third parties. In my free time, I like to play soccer (I'm a bad player) with friends, collaborate with some open-source projects, or develop personal projects.

I'm working with React, Node, Typescript, VTEX IO, micro-services, GraphQL, CI/CD, and Jest.
